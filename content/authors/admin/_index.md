I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Meng Li](https://mengli.me/) at the School of Integrated Circuit, Peking University. Before attending Peking University, I received a bachelor’s degree from Beihang University and served as the captain of SuperComputer Team under the supervision of Prof. Hailong Yang.
My research interests focus on efficient multi-modality AI acceleration algorithms, systems and hardwares.
